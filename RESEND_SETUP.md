## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables

```
RESEND_API_KEY=re_Sj4GfqbE_JZmbSrNpunz5PYo46tz1qXNi
```

### Email Delivery
All form submissions are sent to: **aamro@crexpressinc.com**

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Domain Verification Required

Currently, the forms are using Resend's test email address (`onboarding@resend.dev`). For production use, you need to:

### Steps to Verify Your Domain:

1. **Log in to Resend Dashboard:**
   - Go to https://resend.com/login
   - Use your account credentials

2. **Add Your Domain:**
   - Navigate to "Domains" section
   - Click "Add Domain"
   - Enter: `crexpressinc.com`
   - Follow the DNS verification steps

3. **Add DNS Records:**
   You'll need to add these DNS records to your domain registrar:
   - SPF record
   - DKIM record
   - DMARC record (recommended)

   Resend will provide the exact values in the dashboard.

4. **Update the API Routes:**
   Once verified, update the `from` email in these files:
   - `/src/app/api/submit-job-application/route.ts`
   - `/src/app/api/submit-driver-application/route.ts`
   - `/src/app/api/submit-service-quote/route.ts`
   - `/src/app/api/submit-location-quote/route.ts`

   Change from:
   ```typescript
   from: 'CR EXPRESS <onboarding@resend.dev>',
   ```

   To:
   ```typescript
   from: 'CR EXPRESS <noreply@crexpressinc.com>',
   // or
   from: 'CR EXPRESS Careers <careers@crexpressinc.com>',
   // or
   from: 'CR EXPRESS Quotes <quotes@crexpressinc.com>',
   ```

## üöÄ Testing

### Test Before Domain Verification:
The forms will work with `onboarding@resend.dev`, but emails may go to spam.

### Test After Domain Verification:
1. Fill out each form on your website
2. Check `aamro@crexpressinc.com` inbox
3. Verify:
   - Email arrives within seconds
   - Formatting looks professional
