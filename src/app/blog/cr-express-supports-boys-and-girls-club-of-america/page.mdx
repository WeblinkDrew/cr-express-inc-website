CR Express is proud to announce our partnership with the Boys and Girls Club of America, a charitable organization dedicated to empowering young minds and shaping future leaders. We've taken our commitment a step further by not only making financial contributions but also showcasing our support on one of our semi-trucks, effectively turning it into a rolling billboard for the club's mission.

The Boys and Girls Club of America, with its 5,000+ affiliated clubs serving millions of kids across the nation, has a profound impact on young lives. By providing a safe and supportive environment, they help children achieve academic success, practice good character, and live healthy lives. We are excited to be a part of this initiative, and we even got the chance to host the Boys and Girls Club of Schaumburg, Illinois to visit our facility in Elk Grove Village and learn more about international logistics and see how our operations contribute to making the world a better place.

We believe that by working together, we can create a brighter future for the youth in our communities. Our partnership with the Boys and Girls Club of America is a testament to our commitment to giving back, and we look forward to a long and fruitful collaboration that benefits the children and communities we serve.
