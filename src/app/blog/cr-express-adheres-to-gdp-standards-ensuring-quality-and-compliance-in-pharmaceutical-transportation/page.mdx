At CR Express, we are dedicated to maintaining the highest industry standards and constantly improving our services. As part of this commitment, we are thrilled to announce that we are in the process of becoming a GDP (Good Distribution Practices) compliant carrier, further enhancing our capabilities in pharmaceutical transportation.

GDP compliance is essential when it comes to handling and transporting pharmaceutical products, where strict temperature control, quality assurance, and security are paramount. We understand the critical nature of these requirements and are proud to take the necessary steps to meet and exceed them.

By pursuing GDP compliance, CR Express is reaffirming our commitment to delivering pharmaceuticals safely and securely, from production facilities to pharmacies and medical facilities. This certification will ensure that our services are in line with international pharmaceutical quality standards, providing our customers with peace of mind that their products will arrive in optimal condition.

We are diligently working to align our processes and systems with GDP standards to offer a seamless and reliable pharmaceutical transportation solution. At CR Express, we understand the importance of pharmaceutical logistics in the healthcare industry and are excited to contribute to the well-being of communities by ensuring the safe and efficient distribution of vital medical supplies. Our pursuit of GDP compliance signifies our dedication to the highest quality and compliance standards in the industry.
