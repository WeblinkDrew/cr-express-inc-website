## Frequently Asked Questions

<details>
  <summary>**Why is a private chassis fleet better than using shared pool chassis?**</summary>

  Private chassis eliminate the "grey pool" equipment shortages that plague intermodal drayage. With our owned fleet, you never hear "no chassis available." We control maintenance quality, sizing for customer demand, and equipment positioning. This translates to faster pickup times, better reliability, and no surprise chassis usage fees that can add hundreds of dollars per move.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>**Which railyards do you serve and how quickly can you pick up containers?**</summary>

  We serve all 21 major Chicagoland railyards including BNSF Logistics Park Chicago, UP Global facilities, CSX Bedford Park, NS Landers, CN Harvey, and CP Bensenville, plus all Joliet-area terminals. Standard pickup is same-day or next-day depending on arrival time and railyard. Expedited service can retrieve containers within hours of availability for urgent shipments.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>**Can you handle overweight containers?**</summary>

  Yes, our tri-axle chassis handle containers up to 44,000 lbs cargo weight (67,200 lbs gross including container and chassis). Our experienced drivers and logistics team ensure proper permitting, legal routing, and compliant transport. We regularly move overweight machinery, steel, and industrial equipment shipments.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>**Do you offer weekend and after-hours drayage service?**</summary>

  Absolutely. We operate 7 days a week including weekends and most holidays. Our 24/7 dispatch team coordinates afterhours pickups and deliveries for time-critical shipments. This flexibility is essential for matching railroad operating schedules and meeting tight consignee appointments.
</details>

<details>

  Our secure container yards include fenced facilities with 24/7 video surveillance, online inventory management with real-time visibility, flexible daily/weekly/monthly storage terms, lift equipment for loading/unloading, and container maintenance services. We can store import containers awaiting delivery, loaded export containers before rail movement, or empty equipment for repositioning.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>**Can you coordinate drayage with your warehouse and distribution services?**</summary>

  Yes, that's one of our key advantages. Containers can move directly from railyard to our 280,000 sq ft bonded warehouse for transloading, storage, or cross-docking. This integrated approach eliminates multiple hand-offs, reduces costs, and provides single-source accountability from rail arrival through final delivery. We can also coordinate with our air cargo and OTR services for complete supply chain solutions.
