## Frequently Asked Questions

<details>
  <summary>**How does bonded warehouse storage save my business money?**</summary>

  Bonded warehouse storage defers customs duties and fees until goods are withdrawn from the facility. This can save 15-30% on total import costs by improving cash flow, allowing you to pay duties only when inventory sells. For high-volume importers, this can mean tens of thousands in annual savings. Additionally, goods stored for up to 5 years without duty payment give you flexibility for seasonal inventory and slow-moving products.
