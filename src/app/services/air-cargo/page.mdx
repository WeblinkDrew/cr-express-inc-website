## Frequently Asked Questions

<details>
  <summary>**What's the difference between SIDA-approved and SIDA-badged drivers?**</summary>

  SIDA-approved drivers can access screened cargo areas for standard pickups and deliveries at the airport cargo facilities. SIDA-badged drivers have additional clearance allowing them to access the ramp and perform plane-side deliveries and recoveries, providing the fastest possible service for time-critical shipments by eliminating intermediate handling.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>**How quickly can you recover air cargo after it lands?**</summary>

  For domestic flights, we typically recover cargo within 2-4 hours of touchdown with our standard service. For urgent shipments, our same-day recovery with SIDA-badged drivers can pick up freight directly from the aircraft, enabling delivery within hours of landing. International shipments require customs clearance which typically adds 1-2 hours to the process.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>**Do you handle hazardous materials and dangerous goods?**</summary>

  Yes, we are fully certified for dangerous goods handling in compliance with IATA, DOT, and FAA regulations. Our staff receives regular training on proper handling, documentation, and storage of hazardous materials. We can handle most DG classifications with proper advance notice and documentation.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>**What temperature-controlled capabilities do you have for pharmaceuticals?**</summary>

  Our pharmaceutical cold chain services maintain strict temperature control from airport pickup through final delivery. We use validated thermal packaging, refrigerated vehicles when needed, temperature monitoring devices, and maintain complete chain of custody documentation. Our facilities are GDP compliant with proper storage for temperature-sensitive products.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>**Can you coordinate both O'Hare and Rockford airport shipments?**</summary>

  Absolutely. We maintain operations at both ORD and RFD, allowing us to optimize routing based on your specific needs. Rockford often provides cost advantages and less congestion for certain routes, while O'Hare offers more frequent flights and broader carrier options. We'll recommend the best airport for your shipment.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>**What documentation do I need to provide for international air exports?**</summary>
