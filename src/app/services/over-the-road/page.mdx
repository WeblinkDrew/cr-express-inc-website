## Frequently Asked Questions

<details>
  <summary>**What's the difference between FTL and LTL, and how do I know which I need?**</summary>

  FTL (Full Truckload) is typically used for shipments of 10+ pallets or 15,000+ lbs that justify dedicating an entire trailer. Your freight goes directly from pickup to delivery on one truck with no stops or transfers, providing the fastest transit and least handling. LTL (Less Than Truckload) is cost-effective for smaller shipments (1-9 pallets) where you share trailer space with other customers' freight. LTL involves terminal transfers and consolidation but costs significantly less for partial loads. Our team can help determine the most economical option for your specific shipment.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>**How does real-time GPS tracking work and what information can I see?**</summary>

  All our tractors are equipped with GPS tracking devices that report location every few minutes. You can access our online portal 24/7 to view current location on a map, estimated time of arrival based on actual route progress, recent stops and movements, and delivery status. You'll also receive automated notifications for pickup confirmation, en-route updates, and delivery completion with proof of delivery including time stamps and signatures.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>**What transit times should I expect for different distances?**</summary>

  Transit times vary by distance and service level. Standard FTL service typically provides: 0-500 miles in 1-2 days, 500-1000 miles in 2-3 days, 1000-1500 miles in 3-4 days, and coast-to-coast (2500+ miles) in 5-7 days. Expedited service with team drivers can cut these times by 40-50%. LTL service typically adds 1-2 days to FTL times due to terminal processing. We provide specific transit time estimates for every quote.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>**Do you offer dedicated contract carriage for regular lanes?**</summary>

  Yes, dedicated contract carriage is ideal for businesses with consistent freight needs on specific lanes. You receive committed capacity with the same drivers who learn your requirements, consistent equipment type and condition, predictable pickup and delivery schedules, contracted pricing that's locked in (not subject to spot market fluctuations), and priority service during peak seasons. Minimum volumes typically required - contact us to discuss your specific needs.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>**Can you handle oversized, overweight, or specialized cargo?**</summary>

  Yes, we have specialized equipment and expertise for non-standard freight. Our flatbed trailers handle oversized items that won't fit in standard 53' dry vans. Step-deck and double-drop trailers accommodate tall or extremely heavy cargo. We arrange permits and route planning for overweight and overdimensional loads, provide specialized securement for unusual shapes, and coordinate pilot cars and escort services when required. Our team will assess your specific cargo and recommend the appropriate equipment and routing.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>**What happens if my delivery is delayed due to weather or traffic?**</summary>

  We proactively monitor weather and traffic conditions along your freight's route. If delays are anticipated, our dispatch team contacts you immediately with updated ETAs and options. We reroute when possible to minimize impacts, may add team drivers to expedited shipments to make up time, and maintain 24/7 communication so you're never in the dark. Our on-time performance over 98% reflects our commitment to reliable delivery even when conditions are challenging.
