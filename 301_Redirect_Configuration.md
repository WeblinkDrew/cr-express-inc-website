## üö® TESTING CHECKLIST - CRITICAL

### Pre-Launch Testing (MANDATORY)
- [ ] **Test ALL 5 service page redirects** in staging
- [ ] Verify redirects work with AND without trailing slashes
- [ ] Check no redirect chains exist (must be single hop)
- [ ] Test redirects preserve HTTPS
- [ ] Verify new `/services/` pages are live before redirects

### Service Page Redirect Testing
```bash
# Test each service redirect with curl
curl -I https://staging.crexpressinc.com/warehousing/
curl -I https://staging.crexpressinc.com/air-cargo/
curl -I https://staging.crexpressinc.com/drayage/
curl -I https://staging.crexpressinc.com/over-the-road/
curl -I https://staging.crexpressinc.com/local-pd/

# Should return: HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently
# Location header should show /services/[service-name]/
```

### Post-Launch Monitoring (First 48 Hours)
- [ ] Monitor 404 errors every hour
- [ ] Check Google Search Console for crawl errors
- [ ] Verify organic traffic to service pages
- [ ] Monitor server logs for redirect loops
- [ ] Set up alerts for traffic drops >10%

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPLEMENTATION WARNINGS

### CRITICAL CHECKS BEFORE GOING LIVE:

1. **Verify New Pages Exist**
   - `/services/warehousing/` must be live
   - `/services/air-cargo/` must be live
   - `/services/drayage/` must be live
   - `/services/over-the-road/` must be live
   - `/services/local-pd/` must be live

2. **Check for Redirect Conflicts**
   - Ensure no existing redirects conflict
   - Clear any caching plugins/CDN
   - Test in incognito/private browsing

3. **Preserve SEO Elements**
   - New service pages MUST have same/better metadata
   - Internal links must be updated to new URLs
   - XML sitemap must reflect new structure

---

## üìä IMPACT ASSESSMENT

### High-Risk Pages (Most Traffic/Rankings):
1. **Warehousing** - Primary service, bonded warehouse searches
2. **Drayage** - Major service line, intermodal searches
3. **Air Cargo** - O'Hare/airport related searches
4. **Over the Road** - Trucking/freight searches
5. **Local P&D** - Local delivery searches

### SEO Risk Mitigation:
- Implement redirects IMMEDIATELY when new pages go live
- Submit updated sitemap to Google same day
- Monitor Search Console daily for first week
- Keep redirects in place minimum 12 months

---

## QUICK IMPLEMENTATION - COPY & PASTE

### For Apache .htaccess (Most Common):
```apache
# Add these 5 critical lines immediately
RedirectPermanent /warehousing/ https://crexpressinc.com/services/warehousing/
RedirectPermanent /air-cargo/ https://crexpressinc.com/services/air-cargo/
RedirectPermanent /drayage/ https://crexpressinc.com/services/drayage/
RedirectPermanent /over-the-road/ https://crexpressinc.com/services/over-the-road/
RedirectPermanent /local-pd/ https://crexpressinc.com/services/local-pd/
```
