# CR Express SEO Migration - Executive Summary & Action Plan
## CRITICAL: Service Pages Moving to /services/ Subdirectory

---

## üö® CRITICAL CHANGE ALERT

### Service URL Structure is Changing:
**OLD (Current Live):** `/warehousing/`, `/air-cargo/`, `/drayage/`, etc.

/drayage/ ‚Üí /services/drayage/
/over-the-road/ ‚Üí /services/over-the-road/
/local-pd/ ‚Üí /services/local-pd/
```

|------|---------|----------------|
| **Warehousing** | `/services/warehousing/` | Title, Description, H1 |

   - High organic traffic

2. **Drayage** (`/drayage/` ‚Üí `/services/drayage/`)
   - Major revenue driver
   - Intermodal/container searches

3. **Air Cargo** (`/air-cargo/` ‚Üí `/services/air-cargo/`)
   - O'Hare/airport searches
   - Time-sensitive service

4. **Over the Road** (`/over-the-road/` ‚Üí `/services/over-the-road/`)
   - Trucking/freight searches
   - Nationwide service

5. **Local P&D** (`/local-pd/` ‚Üí `/services/local-pd/`)
   - Local delivery searches

**Expected Temporary Impact:** 10-15% traffic dip for 2-4 weeks
