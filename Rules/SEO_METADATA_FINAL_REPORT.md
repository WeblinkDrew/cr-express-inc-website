## üìù Implementation Technical Details

```typescript
// Static pages use direct export
export const metadata: Metadata = {
  title: 'Page Title',
  description: 'Page description...'
}

// Dynamic city pages use generateMetadata
export async function generateMetadata({ params }): Promise<Metadata> {
  const city = getCityBySlug(citySlug)
  return {
    title: city.seoTitle,
    description: city.seoDescription,
    keywords: city.targetKeywords.join(', '),
    openGraph: {...},
    twitter: {...}
  }
