## 🚀 Deployment Checklist

### Before Production Deployment:
- [x] All redirects implemented in `next.config.mjs`
- [x] Test script created and functional
- [x] All redirects tested locally
- [x] Service pages confirmed to exist at new URLs
- [ ] Test in staging environment
- [ ] Update internal links in content
- [ ] Update XML sitemap
- [ ] Prepare Google Search Console for changes

### Production Deployment Steps:
1. Deploy code with redirect configuration
2. Immediately test all redirects with `test-redirects.js`
3. Submit updated sitemap to Google
4. Monitor 404 errors closely for 48 hours
5. Watch organic traffic in analytics

## 📊 Technical Notes

### Redirect Status Code:
- Next.js uses **308 Permanent Redirect** instead of 301
- This is the modern standard and is fully SEO-compatible
- Google treats 308 the same as 301 for SEO purposes

### Why This Implementation:
- Native Next.js solution (no .htaccess needed)
- Works in all deployment environments
- Automatically handles trailing slashes
- Maintains HTTPS protocol
- Fast execution at the edge

---

## ⚠️ Important Reminders

1. **Keep redirects for minimum 12 months** after migration
2. **Monitor first 48 hours closely** after deployment
3. **City pages remain unchanged** - no redirects needed
4. **Update all internal links** to use new `/services/` URLs

---

## 📞 Support

If any issues arise:
1. Run the test script to identify which redirects are failing
2. Check the Next.js server logs for errors
3. Verify the destination pages exist
4. Clear any CDN/caching if changes aren't appearing

---

## ✅ READY FOR PRODUCTION

All redirects are implemented, tested, and working correctly. The site is ready for migration with minimal SEO risk for the service pages.

**Next Step:** Deploy to staging environment and run the same tests before production deployment.
